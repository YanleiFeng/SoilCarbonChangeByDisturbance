The upper beaver dam is just downstream of the culvert scour pool (the road-crossing is the upstream end of the reach). Approximately 100m downstream is the second beaver dam, which at the time was only partially constructed. There has been a series of beaver dams upstream of the road-crossing since likely before the establishment of HOPB as a NEON site.

As of October 19, the extent and severity of impact to the study reach is unknown and the experimental forest remains closed to entry by NEON staff.
